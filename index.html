        <p>Coronavirus has now contributed to the deaths of more than one million people worldwide.<br><br>
            The report of the millionth death arrived on Tuesday, just short of 10 months since the first confirmed death, in China in January. <br><br>
            The virus is continuing to spread across the world, with more than 30 million confirmed cases in 188 countries.

        <p>
            The virus is surging in many regions and some countries that had apparent success in suppressing initial outbreaks are also seeing infections rise again. <br><br>
            In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 5,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.

        <h3>US has world's highest death toll</h3>
        <p>
            More than 200,000 people have died in the US, making it the world's highest official death toll.<br><br>
            It has also recorded more than seven million cases, about a fifth of the world's total.<br>

            The number of daily tests continues to rise, with more than one million carried out several times since 19 September, according to the US-based <b><u><a href="https://covidtracking.com/data">Covid Tracking Project</a></u></b>. <br><br>
            Hospital admissions and deaths have declined, however, with the seven-day average for deaths remaining below 1,000 since the end of August.<br><br>
            The outbreak has had a devastating impact on the US economy, with GDP <bstrong><u><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53574953">falling by a record rate of 33%</a></u></strong> in the three months from April to June.

        </p>
      
        <h3>Where are cases and deaths rising?</h3>
        <p>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) has <b><u><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54303628"> warned the death toll could hit two million</a></u></b> before an effective vaccine is widely used. <br><br>
            A number of regions have seen new coronavirus cases rise over the last few months, with India driving numbers in Asia. <br>
                <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/17BA6/production/_114709179_optimised-2020-10-01-ecdc.timeseries.continents.cases.plot-nc.png"width="660" height="770"><br>
            The official number of confirmed infections in India has passed six million, the second-highest in the world after the US. <br><br>
            The country has, however, maintained a relatively low death rate given the size of its population. <br><br>             
            In Latin America, newly confirmed cases in Argentina have been rising quickly and the country now has more than 750,000 infections. <br><br>
            In the Middle East, cases in Iraq have been rising steadily since June, with the country fast approaching 400,000 cases. <br><br> 
                <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/1FFE/production/_114709180_optimised-selected_risers_cases_1oct-nc.png"width="700" height="600"><br>
            Cases are also continuing to rise in Indonesia and the country has recorded more than 10,000 deaths - the highest number in South East Asia.<br><br>
            Africa has recorded about 1.5 million confirmed cases, although the true extent of the pandemic there is not known as testing rates are low. South Africa, Morocco and Egypt have seen the largest recorded outbreaks so far on the continent.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Coronavirus cases rising again in Europe</h3>
        <p>
            Several European countries are recording a second rise in the number of daily cases.<br>
                <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/952E/production/_114709183_optimised-second_wave_europe_1oct-nc.png"width="700" height="600"><br>
            A number of European countries have re-imposed lockdowns and other restrictions in their worst-affected regions, and there have been fresh appeals for people to wear face coverings and follow social distancing rules.<br><br>
                <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/BC3E/production/_114709184_optimised-european_countries_cases1oct-nc.png"width="700" height="550"><br>
            The pattern of rising infections following the loosening of lockdown restrictions is not limited to Europe, though.<br><br>
            Israel has imposed a new national lockdown after recording a record number of daily cases in recent weeks.<br><br>
            Other countries that have seen a resurgence of the virus include Peru, Canada and Australia - although following the reintroduction of tougher restrictions some of these are now seeing cases fall again.<br><br>

        <h3>How did coronavirus spread?</h3>
        <p>
            The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019.<br>
                <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/6E1E/production/_114709182_optimised-coronavirus_global_area_chart_new_jh1oct-nc.png"width="700" height="500"><br>   
            The outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020 and declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March.<br><br>
            A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.<br><br>
            <!--How confirmed cases of coronavirus have spread ANIMATION-->  
            Governments across the world have been forced to limit public movement and close businesses and venues in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. This has had a devastating impact on the global economy.<br><br>
            Damage to the world's major economies is <b><u><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sdd/na/g20-gdp-growth-second-quarter-2020-oecd.htm"> four times worse</a></u></b> than the 2009 global financial crisis, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).<br><br>
            Meanwhile, the United Nations has said that <b><u><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53439535">up to 265 million people</a></u></b> could face starvation by the end of the year because of the impact of Covid-19.<br><br>

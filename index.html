        <p>Coronavirus has now contributed to the deaths of more than one million people worldwide.</p>
        <p>The report of the millionth death arrived on Tuesday, just short of 10 months since the first confirmed death, in China in January. <br><br>
            The virus is continuing to spread across the world, with more than 30 million confirmed cases in 188 countries.</p>
        <!--Map-->
        <p>The virus is surging in many regions and some countries that had apparent success in suppressing initial outbreaks are also seeing infections rise again. <br><br>
            In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 5,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.</p>
        
        <h3>US has world's highest death toll</h3>
        <p>More than 200,000 people have died in the US, making it the world's highest official death toll.<br><br>
            It has also recorded more than seven million cases, about a fifth of the world's total.

        <p>The number of daily tests continues to rise, with more than one million carried out several times since 19 September, according to the US-based <b><u><a href="https://covidtracking.com/data">Covid Tracking Project</a></u></b>. <br><br>
            Hospital admissions and deaths have declined, however, with the seven-day average for deaths remaining below 1,000 since the end of August.<br><br>
            The outbreak has had a devastating impact on the US economy, with GDP <bstrong><u><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53574953">falling by a record rate of 33%</a></u></strong> in the three months from April to June.
